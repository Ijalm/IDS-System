Project Title:

Advanced Multi-Model Intrusion Detection System Using KDD Dataset

🔹 Project Description

Design and implement an Advanced Multi-Model Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques to detect and classify network intrusions. The system will utilize the KDDTrain+.txt and KDDTest+.txt datasets to train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms. The objective is to compare the performance of different machine learning models and identify the most effective one for intrusion detection with also live testing . 

Evaluate models using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Compare model performance visually using a bar chart.

🔹 Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib

Joblib


🔹 Expected Outcome

A working multi-model IDS system

Performance comparison of ML algorithms

Visualization of model accuracy
